# PrayPic - App Flow & Features

## Overview

PrayPic is a mobile app designed to encourage and track daily Islamic prayers among friends. Users take a picture to confirm they have completed each of the five daily prayers and share it on their story. The app promotes engagement, accountability, and motivation through announcements, notifications, and a structured tracking system.

Conclusion

PrayPic is a fun and interactive way for friends to stay accountable in performing daily prayers. The app integrates social engagement with prayer tracking, making it easier to build and maintain a consistent prayer habit. The new announcement, reaction, and "Your Heart" features enhance motivation and interaction within the community.
